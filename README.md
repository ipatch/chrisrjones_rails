### Deployment Use Case

For my particular use case, I manage many different Rubies on my system using various different tools such as asdf, homebrew, and RVM, that said, I chose to use RVM to manage the bundled gems used within this app because RVM integrates with Capistrano less painful then other Ruby managers, ie. asdf.  One caveat with using fish shell with RVM is that by default I use asdf Rubies on the daily, and need to switch to RVM when I want to manage gems contained with this app, and also need to start and ssh-agent when deploying this app using fish shell with RVM.

```shell
echo "rvm use [RUBY_VERSION_DEFINED_FOR_THIS APP]"
echo "as of Apr 5, 2019, üëá"
rvm ues 2.6.2
ssh-agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cap production deploy
```

<a id="security"></a>

## Security

To update a vulnerable gem bundled within the app

```shell
bundle update [mr-fancy-vulnerable-gem]
```

<strong>Ex</strong>

```shell
bundle update loofah
```

> The above command is useful for updating gems bundled in the gemset but aren't defined within the `Gemfile`.

<a id="todo"></a>

## TODO

- [ ] update string formatting with those defined in the Rubocop style guidelines for Ruby
- [x] ~~figure out why app isn't running in dev environment ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø~~
